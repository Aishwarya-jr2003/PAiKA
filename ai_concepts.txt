Artificial Intelligence Concepts

Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a subset of AI where systems learn from data without being 
explicitly programmed. Common types include supervised learning, unsupervised 
learning, and reinforcement learning.

Neural Networks:
Inspired by biological neurons, neural networks consist of layers of 
interconnected nodes. Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers.

Large Language Models (LLMs):
LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Llama are trained on massive text datasets to 
understand and generate human-like text. They use transformer architecture 
and attention mechanisms.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
RAG combines information retrieval with text generation. It retrieves relevant 
documents from a database and uses them as context for the LLM to generate 
accurate, grounded answers.

Vector Databases:
Store embeddings (numerical representations of text) for semantic similarity 
search. Examples include ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Weaviate.
