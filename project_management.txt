Project Management Best Practices

Agile Methodology:
Agile is an iterative approach to project management. Work is divided into 
sprints (usually 2 weeks). Daily standup meetings keep team aligned.

Key Ceremonies:
- Sprint Planning: Define sprint goals and tasks
- Daily Standups: 15-minute sync meetings
- Sprint Review: Demo completed work
- Retrospective: Discuss improvements

Kanban Boards:
Visual workflow management using columns like "To Do", "In Progress", "Done".
Helps team see work status at a glance.

Communication Tools:
Popular tools include Slack for messaging, Jira for task tracking, 
Confluence for documentation, and Zoom for video calls.

Time Management:
Use techniques like Pomodoro (25-minute focused work sessions) and time 
blocking to maximize productivity.
