Hi Bob,

I wanted to send you a quick update on our Q1 project goals.

Key Points:
1. We've completed the initial research phase
2. The prototype is 60% done
3. We're on track for the February launch

Next Steps:
- Schedule a review meeting for next week
- Finalize the marketing materials
- Prepare the demo for stakeholders

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
Alice
