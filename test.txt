PAiKA stands for Personal AI Knowledge Assistant. It is an intelligent system 
designed to help users manage and query their personal knowledge base.

Key Features:
- Document ingestion and processing
- Natural language question answering
- Vector database for semantic search
- Privacy-focused local storage
- Web interface for easy interaction

Technology Stack:
PAiKA is built using Python 3.12 as the primary programming language. It uses 
Groq API for natural language understanding. The vector database 
component uses ChromaDB for efficient similarity search. The web interface is built with Streamlit.

Development Timeline:
The project is being developed over 5 weeks, with approximately 1.5 hours of 
work per day. Week 1 focuses on basic functionality. Week 2 adds vector 
database support. Week 3 implements the web interface. Week 4 adds advanced 
features. Week 5 is dedicated to polish and deployment.

Privacy and Security:
PAiKA prioritizes user privacy. All documents are stored locally on the user's 
machine. API calls are made securely with encrypted connections. No user data 
is shared with third parties except for the necessary API calls to OpenAI.
